## Instructions on how to interact with the work(Audio)


**Play/Pause Music：** Click the "Pause" button located at the top left corner to pause the music. Click again to resume the music.


**Observe the Animation：** Observe how the circles and patterns respond to the audio. The animation will keep changing as the music plays.



## Details of my individual approach to animating the group code.


### I choose to use *audio* to drive my individual code



**Animated Properties** 

**1. Circle Sizes:**  The sizes of the concentric circles change based on the frequency spectrum of the audio. This makes the circles expand and contract in response to different frequencies.

**2. Shape Transformations:**  The shapes (circles, squares, and triangles) on the orange rings change based on the audio's frequency spectrum, providing a visually dynamic effect.

**3. Arc Movement:**  The pink arcs change their end angles based on the audio's frequency spectrum, creating a wave-like motion synchronized with the music.



These properties make my work unique as it focuses on audio-responsive animations（mainly shape and size changes）, contrasting with group members who might focus on color changes or revealing/hiding components.
